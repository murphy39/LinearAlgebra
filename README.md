**Brief summary:** This course is a beginning graduate level treatment
of linear algebra in which we focus on finite dimensional vector spaces from a
more general point of view than you might have seen in an undergraduate class.  Some of the topics we cover are the following (from the catalog): Vector spaces, linear transformations, dual spaces, decompositions of spaces, and canonical forms.  A more detailed list of topics appears below.

**Class meetings:** MW, 3:55--5:10, LeConte, Room 310.

**Homework:** Solving problems is the best way to learn this material.  As we progress, I will distribute lists of exercises, both from the textbook and other sources.  Students will be expected to solve and submit as many solutions as possible, and 55% of the grade will be based on the number of correct, well written solutions submitted.

**Exams:** There will be one midterm exam worth 20% of the grade.
It will be scheduled as we progress, and notice of at least one week will be
given prior to the date of a test.  A final exam at the end of the semester will
be worth 25% of the grade. I will be fairly specific about what topics
will be covered on the exams, and many of the problems that appear will be drawn
from the collection of homework problems.

**Computing:**
This is a graduate math course, so the it will be taught from a more abstract and general perspective than undergraduate linear algebra.  However, one of the best ways to develop a deeper understanding of the theory is to use the computer to experiment with and apply it. For this, we will rely on a number of programming languages, depending in part on student backgrounds and interests.  Most likely these will include Matlab/Octave, Sage/Python, C/LAPACK. *No prior programming experience is required for this course.*

**Course topics in more detail:** 
Below is a list of some of the topics we will cover.  In addition to these, we will 
cover vector spaces over finite fields, the 

1.  Fields.
2.  Vector spaces and algebras over a field, isomorphism theorems.
5.  Linear independence, basis, and dimension.
6.  Linear transformations.
7.  The endomorphism algebra of a vector space.
8.  Representation of linear transformations by matrices.
8.  Lattice of subspaces, invariant subspaces.
9.  Determinant and trace.
9.  Spectral theory: eigenvalues, eigenvectors
9.  Euclidean structure: orthonormal bases, norms, spectral radius.
9.  Normed linear spaces and duality.
9.  Spectral theory of self-adjoint mappings.

**Other topics (depending on time and student interest)**

9.  Krylov subspaces.
9.  Selfadjoint endomorphisms.
9.  Unitary and normal endomorphisms.
9.  Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses.
9.  Bilinear transformations and forms.
9.  Matrix inequalities and decompositions.

The course webpage will list the material covered, the assigned homework, test dates, and any
supplemental material. It will be updated often as we progress through the
material, so students should check it routinely.\\ 

**Learning Outcomes:** 

**Academic Honesty:**  Students are held to the highest standards
of academic integrity.  Cheaters are not tolerated and will be
referred to and dealt with by the USC Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner
consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion
from the university.

**Electronics policy:** Please silence and refrain from using all electronic
devices (phones, ipods, tablets, microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam
periods, unless the nature of the class topic requires the use of such devices.
