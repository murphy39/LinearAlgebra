**Brief summary of course topics:** (from the catalog) Vector spaces, linear transformations, dual spaces, decompositions of spaces, and canonical forms.

**Class meetings:** MW, 3:55--5:10, LeConte, Room 310.

**Homework:** Solving homework problems is the easiest, best, and perhaps only way
to properly learn the material.  As we progress, I will distribute lists of
good exercises to work on, either from the textbook or in handouts.  Students
are expected to solve and submit as many solutions as possible.  50% of your grade will
be based on how many correct solutions to exercises you submit.

**Exams:** There will be one mid-term exam worth 20% of the final course grade.
It will be scheduled as we progress, and notice of at least one week will be
given prior to the date of a test.  A final exam at the end of the semester will
be worth 30% of the final course grade. I will be very specific about what topics
will be covered on the exams, and the problems that appear will be drawn mostly
from the homework problems.

**Course topics in more detail:** This is a beginning graduate level treatment of linear algebra in
which we focus on finite dimensional vector spaces from a more general point of
view than you might have seen in an undergraduate class.  Below is a detailed
list of some of the topics we will cover (essentially the first 172 pages of
Lax's book, plus additional topics depending on students' interests).  In
addition to these topics, we will cover vector spaces over finite fields, the
Jordan canonical form and Smith normal form.  Depending on student interest, we
might also spend some time demonstrating and applying the theory using computer
algebra software (like Sage) and numerical software (like Matlab or
Octave/Sage).

**Course Website:**

The course webpage will list the material covered, the assigned homework, test dates, and any
supplemental material. It will be updated often as we progress through the
material, so students should check it routinely.\\ 

**Learning Outcomes:** 

**Academic Honesty:**  Students are held to the highest standards
of academic integrity.  Cheaters are not tolerated and will be
referred to and dealt with by the USC Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner
consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion
from the university.

**Electronics policy:** Please silence and refrain from using all electronic
devices (phones, ipods, tablets, microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam
periods, unless the nature of the class topic requires the use of such devices.
