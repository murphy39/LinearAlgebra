It may also be appropriate for advanced undergraduate math majors,\r\nand graduate students in engineering and computer science.  The focus is on\r\nfinite dimensional vector spaces from a more general point of view than one\r\nfinds in an undergraduate course.  Some of the topics covered are the following\r\n(from the catalog): vector spaces, linear transformations, dual spaces,\r\ndecompositions of spaces, canonical forms.  A more detailed list of topics\r\nappears below. \r\n\r\nTextbook\r\n--------\r\n[The Linear Algebra a Beginning Graduate Student Ought to Know](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9789400726352&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FLinear-Algebra-a-Beginning-Graduate-Student-Ought-to-Know%2FJonathan-S-Golan%2Fe%2F9789400726352), Jonathan Golan.\r\n<!-- GOLAN -->\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9789400726352&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FLinear-Algebra-a-Beginning-Graduate-Student-Ought-to-Know%2FJonathan-S-Golan%2Fe%2F9789400726352\">\r\n<IMG border=0 src=\"http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/229900000/229902005.JPG\" ></a><IMG border=0 style=\"width: 50px;\" src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=xEro7OMQWE4&bids=239662.9789400726352&type=2&subid=0\" >\r\n\r\n**Other references:**\r\n[Linear Algebra and Its Applications](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9780471751564&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FLinear-Algebra-and-Its-Applications%2FPeter-D-Lax%2Fe%2F9780471751564), Peter Lax.  \r\n[Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9781614272816&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FFinite-Dimensional-Vector-Spaces%2FPR-Halmos%2Fe%2F9781614272816), Paul Halmos.  \r\n[Matrix Analysis](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.2580521386329&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FMatrix-Analysis%2FRoger-A-Horn%2Fe%2F2580521386329), Horn and Johnson.   \r\n[Matrix Computations](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9780801854149&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FMatrix-Computations%2FGene-H-Golub%2Fe%2F9780801854149), Golub and Van Loan.  \r\n[Advanced Linear Algebra](http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=239662.9780387728285&type=2&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.barnesandnoble.com%2FAdvanced-Linear-Algebra%2FSteven-Roman%2Fe%2F9780387728285), Steven Roman.\r\n\r\nHomework\r\n--------\r\nSolving problems is the best way to learn this material.  A list of problems,\r\nboth from the textbook and other sources, will be distributed and updated as the\r\ncourse progresses.  Students will solve and submit as many solutions as\r\npossible.  In addition, for each homework assignment, two students will be\r\nresponsible for typing up correct solutions to the homework problems using LaTeX\r\nand submitting them to the [Math700Homework][] repository. \r\n(See [Git and GitHub](#git-and-github) below.)  Homework is worth 50% of the\r\ncourse grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nExams\r\n-----\r\nThere will be one midterm exam worth 20% of the course grade.\r\nIt will be scheduled as we progress, and notice of at least one week will be\r\ngiven prior to the date of a test.  A final exam at the end of the semester will\r\nbe worth 30% of the course grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse topics\r\n-------------\r\n1.  Fields; vector spaces; algebras over a field; isomorphism theorems.\r\n5.  Linear independence; basis and dimension.\r\n6.  Linear transformations.\r\n7.  The endomorphism algebra of a vector space.\r\n8.  Representation of linear transformations by matrices.\r\n8.  Lattice of subspaces and invariant subspaces.\r\n9.  Systems of linear equations.\r\n9.  Determinant and trace.\r\n9.  General and special linear groups: orthogonal and unitary groups.\r\n9.  Spectral theory: eigenvalues, eigenvectors.\r\n9.  Euclidean structure: orthonormal basis, norms, spectral radius.\r\n9.  Normed linear spaces and duality.\r\n9.  Spectral theory of self-adjoint mappings.\r\n\r\n**Other topics (depending on time and student interest)**\r\n\r\n+  Krylov subspaces.\r\n+  Self-adjoint endomorphisms.\r\n+  Unitary and normal endomorphisms.\r\n+  Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses.\r\n+  Bilinear transformations and forms.\r\n+  Matrix inequalities and decompositions.\r\n+  Algebras of linear transformations, simultaneous triangularization.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nComputing\r\n=========\r\nNo prior programming experience is required for this course, and the computing\r\ncomponent of the course will be fairly minimal.  However, all students must know\r\n(or learn) how to type up solutions to *some* of the homework problems using \r\n[LaTeX][], and all students must know (or learn) how to submit *some* of these\r\nsolutions using [Git][] and [GitHub][].  (More information about this below.)\r\n\r\nSage\r\n----\r\nThis is a graduate math course, so it will be taught from a more abstract and\r\ngeneral perspective than undergraduate linear algebra.  However, one of the best\r\nways to develop a deeper understanding of this subject is to use the computer to\r\nexperiment with and apply the theory.  For this we will use the open source math\r\nsoftware called [Sage][].  Sage essentially provides a [Python][] interface to\r\na [vast array][] of well developed and powerful open source mathematical software.\r\n\r\nGetting started with Sage is extremely easy.  You don't even need to install any\r\nsoftware. By using Sage though a web browser you can and do all your computing\r\nand store all your sage \"worksheets\" in the cloud.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to download and install Sage on your own computer.  It is free\r\nand is not hard to install. \r\n\r\nIf you've used Sage before and just need a quick refresher, \r\ncheck out the [Sage Quick Start Guides](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/quickstart.html).  \r\nBe sure to check out the Sage linear algebra documentation:\r\n\r\n+ [Sage Quick Start Section: Linear Algebra](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/Quickstarts/Linear-Algebra.html)\r\n+ [Sage Guided Tour Section: Linear Algebra](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html)\r\n\r\nIf you are brand new to Sage, please try the following:\r\n\r\n1. Go to http://www.sagemath.org/ and click [Try Sage Online](http://cloud.sagemath.com/).  \r\n2. [Getting started using Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/Logging-On.html) explains how to create an account.  \r\n3. Check out the [Sage Thematic Tutorials](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nGit and GitHub\r\n--------------\r\nIn this class, occasionally you will have to submit a homework assignment using \r\n[Git][] and [GitHub][].  These are powerful software services that make it easy\r\nto maintain and collaborate on projects.  You are not expected to have heard of\r\nGit or GitHub before this class, and I am more than willing to work with any\r\nstudent who has limited experience with or knowledge of computers or computing.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Git, please try the [15 Git minute tutorial][].  Also, the\r\n[git--the simple guide][] and the [GitHub help pages][] are excellent.\r\n\r\nGit is very easy to use, and you only need the very basics for what we will do\r\nin this class.  But [the main reason Git was created][] (by Linus Torvalds) was\r\nto make it very easy to do more sophisticated things like branching and \r\nmerging that improve workflow and ease collaboration.\r\n\r\nSubmitting Homework\r\n-------------------\r\nAll students should try to solve all of the assigned homework problems.\r\nHowever, not all solutions will be collected and graded.  Instead, for each\r\nassignment, on a rotating basis, two students will be responsible for solving\r\nand writing up \"official\" solutions for the given assignment. These students\r\nwill then submit their solutions to the [Math700Homework][] repository. Other students\r\nwill then have a chance to look at the official solutions and check them against\r\ntheir own work.  At any time thereafter, any student may submit corrections or\r\nsuggestions for improving the official solutions. \r\n\r\nFor each assignment, the two designated problem solvers should submit their \r\njoint work as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Solve the problems. (Try to make sure they are correct. Consult each other\r\n   and the prof if necessary.)   \r\n2. Type up your solutions using [LaTeX][] and save in a single file, e.g.,\r\n   Homework01.tex.   \r\n3. [Set up Git][] on your computer.   \r\n4. [Fork][] the [Math700Homework][] repository to your computer. (to be demonstrated in class)   \r\n5. Copy your solution file into the directory Math700Homework/Solutions on your computer.   \r\n6. [Commit][] your changes.   \r\n7. Submit a [pull request][].
