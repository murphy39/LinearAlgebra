\noindent {\bf Instructor:} Dr.~William DeMeo  \hfill {Phone: 777-7510}\\
~\phantom{XX} \hfill {Email: \href{mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com}{williamdemeo@gmail.com}}

\noindent {\bf Office:} LeConte College, Room 314C \\

\noindent {\bf Office Hours:} Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 11--12, and by appointment\\

\noindent {\bf Prerequisites:} Grades of C or better in both CSCE 146 and MATH 142.\\

\noindent {\bf Text:} Judith L. Gersting, \emph{Mathematical Structures for Computer Science}, Sixth Edition, W.~H.~Freeman and Company, New York, NY, 2007. \href{http://www.whfreeman.com/gersting}{www.whfreeman.com/gersting}. \\


\noindent {\bf Class Meetings:} MWF, 14:20-15:10, LeConte, Room 115. Students are expected to attend this class in accordance with university policy.\\

\noindent {\bf Exams:} There will be two ``mid-term'' exams during the semester, and will be scheduled as we
progress. Notice of at least one week will be given prior to the date of a
test. A compulsory and comprehensive final exam will be held on Tuesday, December 10, at 12:30pm.  In accordance with university policy, the final exam must be taken by all
students at the scheduled time.\\
 
\noindent {\bf Homework:} Solving homework problems is the easiest, best, and perhaps only way
to properly prepare for tests and quizzes.   Homework will be assigned and
collected regularly, and selected problems from each set will be graded for
correctness. Solutions are due by the end of class on the deadline date
assigned, or can be left at my office \emph{earlier}. Late homework will not be
accepted or graded. Your best ten homework assignments will be counted toward
your grade. \\ 

\noindent {\bf Quizzes:} We will have two quizzes, one after Chapter 1, covering
material from that chapter, and one after Chapter 3, covering the material from
that chapter.  \\

\noindent {\bf Make-up Policy:} \emph{There will be no make-up homework or quizzes for any
  reason.} If you must miss class for a legitimate reason, contact me prior to
the class and we may be able to schedule a time \emph{before} the date in
question. If you miss a test with a legitimate reason, you may come to me within
one class meeting of the missed test and provide an explanation, in which case I might
agree to replace the missed test score with 80\% of your final exam score.
For example, if I accept your excuse and you score 90\% on the final, then I
will give you 72\% on the missed test (0.80*0.90 = 0.72).\\

\noindent {\bf Grading Scheme:} Each test will be worth 25 points, the final
will be worth 30 points, each quiz will be worth 5 points, and homework will be worth 10 points, 
The following scores will guarantee the following grades. I reserve the right to shift the scale at the end of the semester. All curving (if any) will occur at the end of the semester.

$$ \begin{array}{ll}
A&:  91 - 100 \\
B+&: 87 - 91 \\
B &: 81 - 87 \\
C+&: 77 - 81 \\
C &: 71 - 77 \\
D+ &: 67 - 71 \\ 
D &: 60 - 67 \\
F &: 0 -60 
\end{array}$$ \\
    
\noindent {\bf Course Website:}
\url{http://williamdemeo.wordpress.com/teaching/math-374-fall-2013/}\\
The course webpage will list the material covered, the assigned homework, test dates, and any
supplemental material. It will be updated often as we progress through the
material, so you should check it routinely.\\ 

\noindent {\bf Course Content:} We will cover as much as time permits of the
following topics: propositional and predicate logic; proof techniques; recursion
and recurrence relations; sets and combinatorics; functions, relations and
matrices, lattices, graphs and trees. Logic, proof techniques, and recursion provide the
mathematical foundation for both writing a program and demonstrating its
correctness. Sets, combinatorics, functions, relations, matrices and lattices comprise
the most basic objects and relationships that are used in computer
science. Graphs and trees can be used as models of many real world pheneomena,
while also being amenable to computer programming. \\ 

\noindent {\bf Learning Outcomes:} Students are expected to translate English
sentences into predicates and vice versa. They will be able to evaluate truth
values and verify tautologies using methods of logic and will be familiar with
the principles of declarative programming languages. 

Students will be able to write recursive algorithms, prove the correctness of
simple algorithms, solve simple recurrences, and use mathematical induction, in
particular, to show the correctness of loops. 

Students will be able to use the concepts of relations, graphs and matrices to
model real-life situations and to operate within the models they created. 
  
Students are, of course, expected to read the text after class. However, reading
the next section \emph{before} class is also expected. This will help the
students in seeing the outline of the current topic, giving familiarity with the
basic concepts, and help in seeing the fine points of the lecture.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Academic Honesty:} Cheating will not be tolerated in this
course. Violations of this policy will be referred to and dealt with by the USC
Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner consistent with university
regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university. \\

\noindent {\bf Electronics policy:} Please silence and refrain from using all
electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets, microwave ovens, etc.)  during class and exam periods.
